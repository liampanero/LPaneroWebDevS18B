# Liam Panero, WebDev SecB Spring18 Final. 

I startied this time with my media queries, turned out i was missing a vitla meta in "name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"". I corrected this immediately and then worked on the resizing. To do this I only created one tag for the standard phone size as the trigger point, but set my brower preview to the smallest (367px) to be assured my product would scale comfortably, 

There was a lot of frustration with javascript not loading for reasons you remember from the begining of our last class. 

After that day, and a few hours coming through greensock docs, I got a pretty comfortable with java. my biggest pain came from setting up my inViewTriggers and if statements. I would test functionality on one to then have it bug as I expanded, to only then have it fire to the expanded sellection but the firing then bug. This took half a day of debugging to just have a functional frame work. From there it was customizing the greensock animations perpage. That I had fun with but am happy to go to boxing tomorrow and release all the pent up rage i have from de-bugging. I'm uploading so late because I was trying to the very end for my 'header appear on scroll up' but was unsunccessful, I thing greensock was the wrong code to use for than but realized it too late.

all my screen shots are in the 'screenshots' folder in a subfolder 'final'

thank you Katie!

## Summary:

I started everything with a very detailed wireframe in PhotoShopt which was incredibly helpful in know relavtive hieghts and widths for pixels, what the blocking of my css should look like, as well as planning out all of my neccisary ellements.

Moving onward I laid out my html knowing all the containers and could immediately start wokring on css knowing my html was accomidated for

By assigning classes to articles and sections, I was able to create specialized css styles without getting cluttered with ids and class. This, along with working article by article, my css was writted in a way that reflected order and higherarchy making revisions a far easier process

After being relatively happy with my blocking added my websites's fonts through css, writing the command in a seporte css file that is imported into my main.css, and wrote my copy to confirm my block sizing  was appropriate.

Once the text was in the html it was simple to just change the background colors of my blocks because I knew that the only tage with a different background color would be figcaptions.

I had yet to develop the Contact page before feeling fairly finished with my Landing and Who? pages. Instead of stripping the entire page of CSS, I simply reverted every tag under 'main' to that the opacity/blocking background and went through the same ground up styling workflow.

The last thing i did was choose photos, save them for web through photo shop, and then drop them in the html.

## Problems:

The biggest problems I encountered where balancing my uses of percentage-based and pixel-based dimensions to maintain reactivity without deforming the content. This also lead many conversations with myself over the appropriate positioning styels to apply, i.e. floating, relative, absolute, block, inline-block, margin 0 auto. 

Luckly my process made expirimenting with these styles go smoothly since I could easily spot and refference the element to it's style. 

## Moving Forward: 

There are many small animations and interactions, like making the header disappear with down scroll but appear with any upscroll, a gradient transition to the baground triggle by a section. Also Media queries would be nice to address to small erroring with my html, luckly with the reactive design those queries are at most adjustments the hieght and margins at a particular screen size.
