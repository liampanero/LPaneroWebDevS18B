# Week 3 - WebDev Homework: Liam Panero

## Recipe Site given a bit of HTML

The one issue I was having with my css came with my directions (in 'section' tag with class= "directions") not lining up iwth the the ingredients (in an 'aside' tag). The directions always were positioned lower ont he y-axis but without any element occupying the space above it. Playing with some of the verticle margins in the aside did effect the Direction's y-postion however it was never a fix. 

Ultimately I applied postion: relative, top = -27px to section.directions to get the element into the aprioximate correct position. Still interested in why the element wasn't lining up in the first place.
